      <h2>Sock and Key - Songwriting Duo</h3>
        <div class="headshot2" id='image-8'></div>
      <p class="biotext">Socks Whitmore and Evan Johnson make up Sock and Key, a Los Angeles-based musical theatre/singer-songwriter duo.  They make music together to create an emotional, visual experience with narrative; they want their audience to see and feel the meaning of the stories they tell.</p>
      <p class="biotext">Socks and Evan met at CalArts as undergraduates in the music school. Just days after meeting each other, they wrote their first song together: "Sanctuary," a duet about two very different lives that both long for freedom and escape. Soon after, they joined the CalArts Music Source as an official duo.</p>
      <p class="biotext">Their current project is a full-length original musical called "We Are Here." Drawing inspiration from interviews, discussion groups, and intensive research, the show focuses on the topic of mental health in schools. It tells the story of Valerie, a high school guidance counselor, and four of the kids she works with. "We Are Here" aims to break down stigmas surrounding mental health and spur change in the communities it touches. The show will premiere on February 2, 2019, in the Wild Beast Concert Hall starring Socks as Valerie. For more information, contact Socks at sockswhitmore@alum.calarts.edu or Evan Johnson at evanjohnson@alum.calarts.edu.</p>
